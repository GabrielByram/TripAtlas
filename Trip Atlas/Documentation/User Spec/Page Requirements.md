# Page Ideas
    
## Main Atlas Page:

Design a user-friendly map interface that allows users to see all countries/destinations around the world
Include search filters for narrowing down destinations based on factors such as price, climate, and activities
Countries or areas can be highlighted if they match all/most of the searched for requirements
Users can create and switch to different profiles with different preferences -- summer trips, budget trips, etc.
STRETCH GOAL: Users can place on map and rate the destinations they have visited

## User Registration and Login Pages:

Create a simple registration process with fields for email and password
Include a "forgot password" option for users who need to reset their password
Make it easy for users to log in or register using their social media accounts

## Account Page:

Provide users with a page where they can view and manage their saved information

## STRETCH GOAL -- Trip Planning and Itinerary Generation:

Use AI to suggest customized trip itineraries based on user preferences and historical data
Use Expedia and TripAdvisor data to get hotel and flight data and suggestions
Provide options for users to tweak the itinerary based preferences and constraints
Include hotel and amenity suggestions based on web scraping and user preferences

## STRETCH GOAL -- User Stats:

Show users the trips that they have been on
Use graphs or other data visualizations to help users track their travel history and preferences over time
Allow users to rate and provide feedback on destinations, hotels, and activities via integration with google reviews
Use this feedback to improve the app's recommendation engine over time
Provide users with a personalized "favorites" list of top-rated destinations and activities
